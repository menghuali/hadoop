The history of the New York Yankees Major League Baseball team spans more than a century. Frank J. Farrell 
and William Stephen Devery bought the rights to an American League (AL) club in New York City after the 1902 season. 
The team, which became the Yankees in 1913, won their first AL title in 1921, followed by their first World Series 
championship in 1923. Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig were part of the team's Murderers' Row lineup; under Miller Huggins, 
they led the Yankees to a Series championship and a 110-win season, a league record in 1927. The Yankees won the World 
Series every year from 1936 to 1939 with a team that featured Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio. New York set a major league 
record by winning five consecutive championships from 1949 to 1953, and appeared in the World Series nine times during 
the next 11 years. Despite management disputes, the team reached the World Series four times between 1976 and 1981, 
claiming the championship in 1977 and 1978. Their 1998â€“2000 teams were the last to win three straight World Series 
titles. In 2009, they won the title for a record 27th time.
